frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
 This is a simple arcade game.  
Open the index.html file in your browser to load the game.  
Use the directional keys to move your character around the board collecting the gems that appear, if you collide with an enemy bug your gem count will restart back at zero.  Reach the water on the other side to win the game and save your gem score for that game if it is the highest score recorded so far.
Press 'p' to pause/unpause the game and press 'q' to reset your character at the starting grid position.
